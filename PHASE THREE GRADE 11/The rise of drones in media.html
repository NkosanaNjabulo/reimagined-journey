			THE RISE OF DRONES IN MEDIA

			<p>
			DRONE JOURNALISM REFERS TO THE USE OF DRONES FOR NEWSGATHERING PURPOSES. DRONE PHOTOS AND VIDEOS LEND A UNIQUE AERIAL PERSPECTIVE TO EVERYDAY NEWS COVERAGE, ALLOWING JOURNALISTS TO MAKE THEIR REPORTS MORE INSIGHTFUL AND INNOVATIVE. THE USE OF DRONES FOR INFORMATION COLLECTION IN THE JOURNALISM INDUSTRY IS STILL NEW. IN THE PAST, REPORTERS WOULD TAKE AERIAL FOOTAGE WITH HELICOPTERS, WHICH ARE OFTEN RENTED AND INCUR HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS. DRONE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS JOURNALISTS TO TAKE FOOTAGE OF NEWS EVENTS SUCH AS VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, WAR-TORN VILLAGES, AND NATURAL DISASTERS BECAUSE DRONES ARE OPERATED REMOTELY, JOURNALISTS SEE IT AS SAFER AND COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF VIDEO RECORDING, ESPECIALLY IN HIGHLY VULNERABLE COVERAGE. THEIR MODERATELY LOW COSTS ARE NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY MORE AND MORE DRONES ARE FINDING THEIR WAY TO THE NEWSROOM. UNLIKE HELICOPTERS, USING DRONES MEANS YOUâ€™RE NOT PUTTING HUMAN LIFE AT RISK. CAPTURING THE SITE OF A CHEMICAL FACTORY ACCIDENT OR A TOXIC SPILL WITH A DRONE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS EXPONENTIALLY SAFER THAN USING A MANNED AIRCRAFT FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.
